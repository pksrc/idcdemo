For many of us, it was a textbook or a resold collector’s item from an online auction site. Fast forward to today—a mere 25 year journey—and there are two whole generations who couldn’t comprehend that before they were born, you couldn’t open an app and have something delivered in two days or less. Or even more recently, pull up to the curb and get it within 2 hours of your order.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eOnline shopping is a way of modern life. And it’s now so common that the e-commerce market value exceeded $10 trillion in 2020, according to \u003ca href=\"https://99firms.com/blog/ecommerce-statistics/#gref\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eGrand View Research\u003c/a\u003e.

Customers demanded efficiency, but no one had the infrastructure in place—the warehouses and logistics—that Amazon did, “so retailers had to catch up and it took them quite a while…but shoppers demanded it… They really drove the process,” Skorupa said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eBecause there’s a lot of efficiency in shopping from home, retailers began to imagine scenarios that could optimally blend physical and online retail for the benefit of both customers and brands. Today, that connected, seamless experience is known as the omni-channel experience. And digital technology is key to its success.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003e“The Lonely Roll of Toilet Paper”\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eAmid 2020’s shelter-in-place mandates, retailers had to pivot quickly to support social distancing and at-home shopping. They also had to scramble as customers surged into stores, cleared items off shelves (like toilet paper!) and put pressure on supply chains.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://www.dickssportinggoods.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eDICK’S Sporting Goods\u003c/a\u003e, for example, saw a significant spike in demand for sports such as golf and tennis, as well as fitness. “We had to really figure out ways to provide that product to our customers and in a safe way,” explained Jason Williams, VP of Athlete Technology at DICK’S Sporting Goods.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003e“We often reference our contactless curbside pickup process as one of the big wins that we had during that time. We will deliver that service within 48 hours,” Williams said.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003ch4\u003eIt’s All About the App\u003c/h4\u003e\n\n\n\n\u003cp\u003eDICK’S Sporting Goods—which, at its roots, is customer-athlete obsessed—was among those most ready for the acceleration of online buying. Its digital foundation already enabled e-commerce and omni-channel experiences.

The result was an information security team with a resilient and nimble mindset, said Sanders—one that wasn’t easily rattled by change because it was always thinking outside the box.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor many security organizations, a need to appear “mature” leads them to automate many processes and build layer upon layer. “Like a geological formation,” Weinman said. “Hard and inflexible, weighing us down along with the business units we work with. How many things exist so that we can check a box for some long-forgotten reason?”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the current landscape, as companies go wide angle to consider a spectrum of security threats, everything should be on the table. All security practices should be open to challenge and, if appropriate, be thrown aside. As long as an organization can map a security practice back to a business goal or a cyber-hygiene fundamental, it can validate its decisions. If it can’t, it needs to be open to new ideas, which often come from its newest employees.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“It’s not just a good idea to throw things out, it’s a survival tactic,” said Weinman.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo scale and remain agile, organizations must constantly challenge the “how” of cybersecurity, as well as the “why.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eHard Truth 3: Security Is Not a Solo Sport\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNo single group or organization can stem the tide of security threats. Put simply, we’re all in this together. The security community must make best practices available to everyone. It’s one thing to lead the security team inside an organization and champion the tools that will protect the network and allow it to pass a security audit.

Lopez believes, “Teams now have to focus on pervasive experience. No matter where you are, you have a similar feeling that you can get the same things done no matter the device.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraditionally, developers have been unable to give people everything they can get in a PC experience because so many processes are highly customized,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnterprises must step back and examine the parts of each process to find the pieces delivering the value. For example, do customers come to a business for its highly customized supply chain process or its product? Chances are it’s the product, she says. This should be a signal for the organization to reduce some customization in favor of providing more consistent cross-channel experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Power of Design Thinking\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way to uncover an app’s essence is to take complicated applications through a \u003ca href=\"https://news.vmware.com/nologies/design-thinking-julie-stanford\"\u003edesign thinking process\u003c/a\u003e. This ensures teams distill each app to its core value with the optimal workflow—whether that’s enabling dynamic pricing or expense report approvals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA workflow is an action. And when you see organizations with really good workflows, you’re looking at very good business processes. Under the surface, those workflows touch multiple apps to fully complete a process. Think about service technicians with iPads, for example. They can tap into one app and seamlessly launch three or four different workflows. According to Lopez, this capability “becomes very interesting and very powerful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see teams redesigning this way now and a big move toward the concept of human-centered design. For example, in automotive companies this is now pervasive thinking, which is really important,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short context, connection through integration and cross-channel consistency will make modern apps more impactful and useful. Only then can the app experience truly be the customer experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Third Dimension: Infrastructure Implications\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnabling connected workflows in and across apps will require more than development skill sets. “It’s going to take a rethink of infrastructure and security, too,” says Lopez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the pandemic hit, nearly all organizations were doing some form of a \u003ca href=\"https://news.vmware.com/c/cloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ecloud strategy\u003c/a\u003e. “Everybody was looking at public, private and hybrid cloud. Everybody was thinking about or already building a multi-cloud strategy,” she says. Multi-cloud involves having parts of infrastructure on-premises and parts in the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest challenge facing teams was adding and migrating workloads between cloud options. Now that work is different, Lopez believes we’ve entered into “the third dimension, which is some portion of always-distributed workers—but not always the same group of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_22220\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.vmware.comcustomer-app-experience-business-success/\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-22220\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-22220\" src=\"https://news-editor.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Modern-App-Customer-Experience_VMware-RADIUS-2-300x158.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-22220\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.vmware.comcustomer-app-experience-business-success/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eRelated Story: The Connection Between the App Experience \u0026amp; Customer Experience\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProductivity is paramount in all cases, so the infrastructure has to change. Teams can no longer optimize computing resources for work across a single building or campus. Instead, they must consider how to scale resources and end-user access at different periods of time and locations using clouds with virtual desktops (VDI), as an example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this new world, IT will have to reimagine what infrastructure gets served from where and how security can be maintained but done differently—without burdening workforces. IT has to consider where workloads live (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google or another cloud platform) and how to take previously locked down workloads to other places. Enterprises need a clear multi-cloud strategy and understanding about how to integrate points that previously weren’t considered part of the corporate enterprise, Lopez says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of this shared experience, Lopez believes the whole concept of infrastructure and how it’s managed will be more diverse. “Less centralized, but still very directed just not all in the same way,” she says. For example, enabling employees to have access to everything they need will be important. Yet, resources are likely to be delivered a certain way when someone is in the office and a different way when working from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnical support structures must change, too. Without human-to-human interactions, how do employees and customers get queries answered and challenges solved when there is no one to call? This is where chatbots come in, says Lopez. She cites a recent example where chatbot technology enabled the automated distribution of information without going through redundant questions. This streamlined interaction made the person-to-person engagement, once it did happen, more effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n\n\n\u003cfigure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"\u003e\u003cblockquote\u003e\u003cp\u003eIT leaders embracing third-dimension thinking will be the ones leading the most adaptive organizations.\u003c/p\u003e\u003ccite\u003eMaribel Lopez, technology industry analyst and strategic advisor, Lopez Research\u003c/cite\u003e\u003c/blockquote\u003e\u003c/figure\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Best Human-First Enterprise Tech Platforms…Wait for It…Aren’t Even Built Yet\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough teams are trying, Lopez hasn’t seen an ideal human-first technology platform for the enterprise. “They aren’t built yet. But we’re getting closer with some human-first mobile apps and aligned IT and business leaders willing to take on the bigger issue, which is the process,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s possible now to deliver faster, easier access to data and apps in technologies like the \u003ca href=\"https://news.vmware.com/c/digital-workspace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003edigital workspace\u003c/a\u003e. But if the experience with individual apps is still poor, people will be frustrated. Part of the challenge, says Lopez, is terminology, which is often too technical and not human-centric. The other is the end-to-end process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnology will need to get simpler and self-service has to become the norm, not the exception. Yet, teams can’t use automation as a crutch to avoid rethinking broken processes, says Lopez. Apps and devices must be so easy that anyone can troubleshoot them. It’s going to be impossible with flex remote working schedules to scale effective tech support at work. And it’ll be even harder for industries like retail to help non-tech savvy customers to navigate grocery shopping online, she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerging technologies like chatbots and \u003ca href=\"https://news.vmware.com/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eartificial intelligence\u003c/a\u003e can help, she says.

What happened was the rest of our experience was so broken that in most cases, we couldn’t do cross-channel well.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eShe cites two examples:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen ordering products via the web is faster than navigating 10-plus clicks on a smartphone, why would people use an app?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWhen changing airline reservations is faster through the app, why would people pick up the phone?\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTrue digital transformation means delivering the same one-or-two click experience across every channel—web, mobile devices, tablets and more. Lopez believes, “Teams now have to focus on pervasive experience. No matter where you are, you have a similar feeling that you can get the same things done no matter the device.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTraditionally, developers have been unable to give people everything they can get in a PC experience because so many processes are highly customized,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnterprises must step back and examine the parts of each process to find the pieces delivering the value. For example, do customers come to a business for its highly customized supply chain process or its product? Chances are it’s the product, she says. This should be a signal for the organization to reduce some customization in favor of providing more consistent cross-channel experiences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Power of Design Thinking\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe way to uncover an app’s essence is to take complicated applications through a \u003ca href=\"https://news.vmware.com/nologies/design-thinking-julie-stanford\"\u003edesign thinking process\u003c/a\u003e. This ensures teams distill each app to its core value with the optimal workflow—whether that’s enabling dynamic pricing or expense report approvals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eA workflow is an action. And when you see organizations with really good workflows, you’re looking at very good business processes. Under the surface, those workflows touch multiple apps to fully complete a process. Think about service technicians with iPads, for example. They can tap into one app and seamlessly launch three or four different workflows. According to Lopez, this capability “becomes very interesting and very powerful.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I see teams redesigning this way now and a big move toward the concept of human-centered design. For example, in automotive companies this is now pervasive thinking, which is really important,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn short context, connection through integration and cross-channel consistency will make modern apps more impactful and useful. Only then can the app experience truly be the customer experience.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eThe Third Dimension: Infrastructure Implications\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEnabling connected workflows in and across apps will require more than development skill sets. “It’s going to take a rethink of infrastructure and security, too,” says Lopez.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhen the pandemic hit, nearly all organizations were doing some form of a \u003ca href=\"https://news.vmware.com/c/cloud/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003ecloud strategy\u003c/a\u003e. “Everybody was looking at public, private and hybrid cloud. Everybody was thinking about or already building a multi-cloud strategy,” she says. Multi-cloud involves having parts of infrastructure on-premises and parts in the cloud.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe biggest challenge facing teams was adding and migrating workloads between cloud options. Now that work is different, Lopez believes we’ve entered into “the third dimension, which is some portion of always-distributed workers—but not always the same group of them.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cdiv id=\"attachment_22220\" style=\"width: 310px\" class=\"wp-caption alignright\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.vmware.comcustomer-app-experience-business-success/\"\u003e\u003cimg aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-22220\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-medium wp-image-22220\" src=\"https://news-editor.vmware.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Modern-App-Customer-Experience_VMware-RADIUS-2-300x158.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e\u003cp id=\"caption-attachment-22220\" class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"https://news.vmware.comcustomer-app-experience-business-success/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eRelated Story: The Connection Between the App Experience \u0026#038; Customer Experience\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\u003c/div\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eProductivity is paramount in all cases, so the infrastructure has to change. Teams can no longer optimize computing resources for work across a single building or campus. Instead, they must consider how to scale resources and end-user access at different periods of time and locations using clouds with virtual desktops (VDI), as an example.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn this new world, IT will have to reimagine what infrastructure gets served from where and how security can be maintained but done differently—without burdening workforces. IT has to consider where workloads live (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google or another cloud platform) and how to take previously locked down workloads to other places. Enterprises need a clear multi-cloud strategy and understanding about how to integrate points that previously weren’t considered part of the corporate enterprise, Lopez says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a result of this shared experience, Lopez believes the whole concept of infrastructure and how it’s managed will be more diverse. “Less centralized, but still very directed just not all in the same way,” she says. For example, enabling employees to have access to everything they need will be important. Yet, resources are likely to be delivered a certain way when someone is in the office and a different way when working from home.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnical support structures must change, too. Without human-to-human interactions, how do employees and customers get queries answered and challenges solved when there is no one to call? This is where chatbots come in, says Lopez. She cites a recent example where chatbot technology enabled the automated distribution of information without going through redundant questions. This streamlined interaction made the person-to-person engagement, once it did happen, more effective.\u003c/p\u003e\n"},"innerBlocks":[]},{"clientId":"2ca1692c-faa2-4f90-8ca9-d63038bf84b0","name":"core/pullquote","attributes":{"value":"\u003cp\u003eIT leaders embracing third-dimension thinking will be the ones leading the most adaptive organizations.\u003c/p\u003e","citation":"Maribel Lopez, technology industry analyst and strategic advisor, Lopez Research"},"innerBlocks":[]},{"clientId":"2d7f5c19-ce94-4ad2-b23f-c1cf47f07b66","name":"core/freeform","attributes":{"content":"\u003ch2\u003eThe Best Human-First Enterprise Tech Platforms…Wait for It…Aren’t Even Built Yet\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAlthough teams are trying, Lopez hasn’t seen an ideal human-first technology platform for the enterprise. “They aren’t built yet. But we’re getting closer with some human-first mobile apps and aligned IT and business leaders willing to take on the bigger issue, which is the process,” she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIt’s possible now to deliver faster, easier access to data and apps in technologies like the \u003ca href=\"https://news.vmware.com/c/digital-workspace/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003edigital workspace\u003c/a\u003e. But if the experience with individual apps is still poor, people will be frustrated. Part of the challenge, says Lopez, is terminology, which is often too technical and not human-centric. The other is the end-to-end process.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTechnology will need to get simpler and self-service has to become the norm, not the exception. Yet, teams can’t use automation as a crutch to avoid rethinking broken processes, says Lopez. Apps and devices must be so easy that anyone can troubleshoot them. It’s going to be impossible with flex remote working schedules to scale effective tech support at work. And it’ll be even harder for industries like retail to help non-tech savvy customers to navigate grocery shopping online, she says.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eEmerging technologies like chatbots and \u003ca href=\"https://news.vmware.com/artificial-intelligence/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"\u003eartificial intelligence\u003c/a\u003e can help, she says. But the key to success is on her wish list: better conversational and natural language interfaces.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eEmbracing Future-Ready Business\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDespite the debate, digital transformation efforts are succeeding. But it can be even more successful when businesses embrace a \u003cem\u003enew\u003c/em\u003e digital. Yet, how they get there will depend on their willingness to envision customer and employee experiences differently. Ultimately, successful future-ready businesses will find the connections and redefine the workflows that matter.

VMware Retail Solutions evolve legacy retail infrastructure into modern digital foundations with mobile workflows that can significantly increase customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. With VMware, retailers customize engagement while improving IT efficiency, agility, and performance from core to cloud to edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Accelerate Retail IT Delivery\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003cbr /\u003eModern IT powers exceptional customer experiences. By speeding digital and in-store service delivery and reducing complexity, VMware software-defined data center (SDDC) solutions empower retailers to improve processes from checkout to supply chain management. Flexible, more secure, and cloud-ready digital infrastructure from VMware improves operational models to help create frictionless retail environments that can accelerate innovation and grow revenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChemist Warehouse\u003c/strong\u003e is a provider of pharmaceuticals, health, and beauty products and one of the largest retailers in Australia with over 500 locations within Australia and New Zealand. Like many growing retailers, Chemist Warehouse needed to modernize its IT infrastructure in order to keep up with the speed and scale of the business. The company worked with VMware to virtualize its compute, storage and networking infrastructure with VMware’s suite of SDDC solutions. In doing so, Chemist Warehouse unified and automated these IT environments with the same architectural structure extending from the data center to the pharmacy floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are committed to finding new and exciting ways to engage customers at every touchpoint – from the moment they walk into a store until they walk out, and beyond,” said Simon Hibbert, General Manager of IT at Chemist Warehouse Group. “The higher levels of standardization and automation achieved through virtualization enabled our team improve the agility and performance of our operations. This optimization ultimately helps us deliver solutions which allow our staff to focus on our customer rather than technology. The VMware portfolio has been instrumental in our agility and has allowed us to scale our store base and offering globally.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChow Sang Sang\u003c/strong\u003e a premier jewelry retailer in Greater China currently has a retail network of more than 600 stores across the region.

VMware SDDC solutions provide the ideal architecture for private, public, and hybrid clouds while VMware Enterprise PKS dynamically and more securely automates Kubernetes-based containerized applications in multi-cloud environments. With built-in critical production capabilities such as high availability, auto-scaling, health checks and self-healing, VMware Enterprise PKS optimizes computing resources among applications to maintain their desired state. This helps better enable the high availability of Chow Sang Sang\u0026#8217;s e-commerce applications. Finally, running on the pre-tested and fully-integrated Dell EMC VxRail, Chow Sang Sang no longer worries about compatibility, reliability and performance issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Empower the Retail Workforce and Drive Exceptional Customer Experiences \u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003eToday\u0026#8217;s shoppers demand personalized, anytime, anywhere experiences.

VMware Retail Solutions evolve legacy retail infrastructure into modern digital foundations with mobile workflows that can significantly increase customer satisfaction and workforce productivity. With VMware, retailers customize engagement while improving IT efficiency, agility, and performance from core to cloud to edge.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Accelerate Retail IT Delivery\u003c/strong\u003e  \u003cbr /\u003eModern IT powers exceptional customer experiences. By speeding digital and in-store service delivery and reducing complexity, VMware software-defined data center (SDDC) solutions empower retailers to improve processes from checkout to supply chain management. Flexible, more secure, and cloud-ready digital infrastructure from VMware improves operational models to help create frictionless retail environments that can accelerate innovation and grow revenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChemist Warehouse\u003c/strong\u003e is a provider of pharmaceuticals, health, and beauty products and one of the largest retailers in Australia with over 500 locations within Australia and New Zealand. Like many growing retailers, Chemist Warehouse needed to modernize its IT infrastructure in order to keep up with the speed and scale of the business. The company worked with VMware to virtualize its compute, storage and networking infrastructure with VMware’s suite of SDDC solutions. In doing so, Chemist Warehouse unified and automated these IT environments with the same architectural structure extending from the data center to the pharmacy floor.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are committed to finding new and exciting ways to engage customers at every touchpoint – from the moment they walk into a store until they walk out, and beyond,” said Simon Hibbert, General Manager of IT at Chemist Warehouse Group. “The higher levels of standardization and automation achieved through virtualization enabled our team improve the agility and performance of our operations. This optimization ultimately helps us deliver solutions which allow our staff to focus on our customer rather than technology. The VMware portfolio has been instrumental in our agility and has allowed us to scale our store base and offering globally.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eChow Sang Sang\u003c/strong\u003e a premier jewelry retailer in Greater China currently has a retail network of more than 600 stores across the region.

Its online business created a significant new revenue stream, but also drove such a surge in demand that its legacy IT infrastructure was unable to support.

VMware SDDC solutions provide the ideal architecture for private, public, and hybrid clouds while VMware Enterprise PKS dynamically and more securely automates Kubernetes-based containerized applications in multi-cloud environments. With built-in critical production capabilities such as high availability, auto-scaling, health checks and self-healing, VMware Enterprise PKS optimizes computing resources among applications to maintain their desired state. This helps better enable the high availability of Chow Sang Sang\u0026#8217;s e-commerce applications. Finally, running on the pre-tested and fully-integrated Dell EMC VxRail, Chow Sang Sang no longer worries about compatibility, reliability and performance issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e Empower the Retail Workforce and Drive Exceptional Customer Experiences \u003c/strong\u003e \u003cbr /\u003eToday\u0026#8217;s shoppers demand personalized, anytime, anywhere experiences.
